# Time-Series-Regression-Model-for-Bike-Rental-Cycles-and-Weather-Data-Analysis


This project focuses on developing a robust time-series regression model that integrates bike rental cycle data with weather data.The project handles data preprocessing, outlier detection,
and advanced exploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques. The model buildingprocess involves the utilization of both standard dense neural networks and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) 
to ensure accurate predictions and optimal performance. Additionally, the project emphasizes the significance of data scaling techniques for uniform data distribution. The implemented 
model's performance is evaluated using standard metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). This comprehensive project showcases the successful 
integration of complex datasets and the development of sophisticated machine learning models for time-series regression analysis.
